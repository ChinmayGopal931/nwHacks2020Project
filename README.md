#Influency - Our NwHacks 2020 project-https://devpost.com/software/influency
Influency is intended for Companies who are looking to gain a social media presance and allow Instgram inflencers to market their product. 
Our Software uses Google Vision's Machine Learning algorithm and a budgeting algorithm to find relavant Influencers.

Technical Details:
-The front-end was built with tinker and used to get images and a budget from the user.
-We then uploaded photoes to Vision Api and generated distingusing feature words of the object(For example a hoodie would bring up words like cotton, soft, clothing, fashion). 


We then built a web scraper to autmatically search for instagram accounts using the feature word hastag(#sweater). 

Our scraper would then find accounts of people who have posted photos using these hashtags and return them. These accounts would then be fed into the budget algorithm for selection based on user settings.

Finally, your company can find Influencers to Market your product worldwide.
